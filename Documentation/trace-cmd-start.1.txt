TRACE-CMD-START(1)
===================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-start - start the Ftrace Linux kernel tracer without recording

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd start* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) start enables all the Ftrace tracing the same way
trace-cmd-record(1) does. The difference is that it does not run threads to
create a trace.dat file. This is useful just to enable Ftrace and you are only
interested in the trace after some event has occurred and the trace is
stopped. Then the trace can be read straight from the Ftrace pseudo file
system or can be extracted with trace-cmd-extract(1).

OPTIONS
-------
The options are the same as 'trace-cmd-record(1)', except that it does not
take options specific to recording (*-s*, *-o*, *-F*, *-N*, and *-t*).

SEE ALSO
--------

trace-cmd-list(1), trace-cmd-listen(1)
