TRACE-CMD-HIST(1)
==================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-hist - show histogram of events in trace.dat file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd hist* ['OPTIONS']['input-file']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) hist displays a histogram form from the trace.dat file.
Instead of showing the events as they were ordered, it creates a histogram
that can be displayed per task or for all tasks where the most common
events appear first. It uses the function tracer and call stacks that it
finds to try to put together a call graph of the events.

OPTIONS
-------
*-i* 'input-file'::
    By default, trace-cmd hist will read the file 'trace.dat'. But the *-i*
    option open up the given 'input-file' instead. Note, the input file may
    also be specified as the last item on the command line.

*-P*::
    To compact all events and show the call graphs by ignoring tasks
    and different PIDs, add the *-P* to do so. Instead of showing the
    task name, it will group all chains together and show "<all pids>".
