TRACE-CMD-STREAM(1)
===================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-stream - stream a trace to stdout as it is happening

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd stream ['OPTIONS']* ['command']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) stream will start tracing just like trace-cmd-record(1), except
it will not record to a file and instead it will read the binary buffer
as it is happening, convert it to a human readable format and write it to
stdout.

This is basically the same as trace-cmd-start(1) and then doing a trace-cmd-show(1)
with the *-p* option. trace-cmd-stream is not as efficient as reading from the
pipe file as most of the stream work is done in userspace. This is useful if
it is needed to do the work mostly in userspace instead of the kernel, and stream
also helps to debug trace-cmd-profile(1) which uses the stream code to perform
the live data analysis for the profile.


OPTIONS
-------
   These are the same as trace-cmd-record(1), except that it does not take
   the *-o* option.
